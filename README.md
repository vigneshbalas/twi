 A lone jedi knight traveled had to travel far and wide across the galaxy, even with the help of the force, he found it hard to keep track of different timezones....

Help me master, he knelt beside his grand master **Yoda**. Help me to quickly navigate the times... I need to convert dates and time quickly...

The master slowly opened his eyes, "Time what is? You ask".Hmm? Hmm.. I will help.. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is..

He then flicked his finger....................
